# DPPN: Deep Progression Predictor in NMIBC
### A procedure of training and test of prediction model for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) progression

## Abstract
Background: Recent advances in high-throughput technology and data-driven approaches have yielded many insights into non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC); however, previous studies have been limited in their ability to predict NMIBC clinical behavior, including response to intravesical therapy. Using a deep learning method and long-term follow-up data, we aim to create a prognostic index (PI) consisting of a small gene group that predicts NMIBC progression and response to intravesical bacillus calmette-gu√©rin (BCG) therapy.

Experimental Design: We used Cox regression analysis to identify progression-associated genes in five independent cohorts of 825 NMIBC patients and validated their predictive values with a fully connected neural network (FNN) algorithm. Using a pathway enrichment analysis on these genes, a PI system consisting of small core genes for NMIBC progression was developed. The relationship between the PI and NMIBC prognosis was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier plots, log-rank tests, and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining.

Results: Gene expression profiling in NMIBC patients revealed a prognostic gene set of 1,789 genes for predicting NMIBC progression in a patient cohort (training set, n = 103). Their prognostic significances were validated in four additional independent cohorts using the FNN algorithm (validation sets, n = 722). Pathway enrichment and IHC analyses revealed a 23-gene signature that included known prognostic transcription factors like FOXM1 and E2F1 as well as novel genes. These genes were incorporated into the PI system, which was a significant prognostic indicator of NMIBC progression. A multivariate analysis and subset stratification based on stage and grade revealed that the PI system was an independent risk factor (HR 4.95, 95% CI=1.54 to 15.885, p=0.007). Additionally, the subset analysis showed that the PI system was capable of identifying patients who would benefit from BCG immunotherapy.

Conclusions: The 23 gene-based PI is a promising diagnostic tool for identifying high-risk NMIBC patients who will exhibit different clinical behaviors and responses to BCG immunotherapy.

The codes in the Python language that describe the training and validation procedures of the prediction model based on FNN algorithm are available in this repository. The entire procedure is described in the Python language and provided as a Jupyter notebook script named DPPN.ipynb.
